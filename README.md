Lightweight and Highly-Modular library of mostly random helper functions and methods to remove some of the gratuitousness of JavaScript.

* **Lightweight** - pitfall tries to have a minimal footprint on your system, to avoid the fated 1gb node_modules folder.
* **Modular** - You are able to use the entire library, down to certain categories of helper functions, and even cherry-pick individual functions. How's that for light?
* **Easy to Use** - With short and concise names inspired from other std and community libraries, pitfall.js is a breeze to use.

## Installation

NPM: `npm install pitfall.js`

Yarn: `yarn install pitfall.js`

pitfall.js is not yet ready for a browser environment, but when it is, it will be available as a standalone js file or from a CDN.

## Documentation

pitfall.js does not yet have any *real* documentation, but it is coming if the library gets enough use.
